## Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Exploration**
- Analyzed election datasets containing voter demographics, state-wise turnout, party performance, and EVM-based voting details.
- Key fields examined:
  - State and district-wise voting counts.
  - Party-wise vote shares.
  - Election win/loss statistics.

### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and standardized data to ensure accuracy and consistency:
  - Addressed missing values in voter turnout data.
  - Standardized party names and state codes.
  - Verified consistency in numerical data such as voter counts and percentages.

### 3. **Data Modeling**
- Established relationships between data tables using unique identifiers such as state names and party IDs.
- Created calculated measures for:
  - Total votes per party.
  - Percentage share of votes.
  - Win/Loss margins.

### 4. **Dashboard Design**
- Developed an interactive dashboard with the following features:
  - **State-wise Voting Trends**: Bar chart showcasing voter turnout by state.
  - **Geographical Insights**: Map visual highlighting voting patterns across states and union territories.
  - **Party-wise Vote Share**: Pie chart illustrating vote distribution across parties.
  - **Election Wins/Losses**: Tabular and visual representation of party performances.
  - **EVM Vote Distribution**: Bar chart displaying votes received by parties via electronic voting machines.

### 5. **Insights from the Dashboard**
- **State Performance**:
  - Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest voter turnout (88M), followed by West Bengal (60M) and Maharashtra (57M).
  - Smaller states like Tripura and Meghalaya had lower voter counts but showed high engagement rates.
- **Party Trends**:
  - Party A secured a significant majority with 58.43% of total votes.
  - Regional parties performed well in specific states, reflecting localized support.
- **Geographical Patterns**:
  - Northern states showed higher voter participation compared to the southern states.
- **EVM Insights**:
  - Party B received the highest EVM votes, demonstrating strong grassroots mobilization.
